# DecibelMeterVHDL

I was tasked with creating an open ended project that utilized the Zybo FPGA, at a least two PMODs. I decided to create a decibel meter that would measure the noisy environment in real time using my iPhone and sending the data over bluetooth to the Zybo FPGA. There are multiple implementations each using a different set of PMODs.
